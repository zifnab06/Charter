#The official Junction server charter

##General Guidelines
Everyone is equal - including staff. Any decisions should be made as laid out in these guidelines, removing the need for any individual to act as if htey are in charge. Junction is a server based around a community working together to have fun. 

##Player Guidelines
###General Rules
1\. **Be respectful of everyone on the server**, whether they are a new player or a staff member. Disrespectful actions include (but are not limited to)
  * Using racial or homophobic slurs
  * Player and/or staff harrassment
  * Being an annoyance to other players
  * Behaving in a way that is disruptive and/or unhelpful

2\. **Do not promote griefing non-chaos servers** using any form of communication provided by Junction. This includes in-game chat, subreddit, Mumble, forum, or IRC channels. 

3\. **Use of mods that give you an advantage over other players is unacceptable**. This includes (but is not limited to):
  * X-Ray (All of your edits will be removed)
  * Speed Hacking
  * Fly Hacking

4\. **Do not create lag machines**. This includes redstone clocks that can not be turned off. 

5\. **Keep the server SFW**. This includes all skins and builds. Offensive skins (such as hitler) are not allowed, you will be kicked for using one. Offensive structures will result in a ban. 

6\. **Please don't spam chat or advertise other servers**


###PvE
1\. **No griefing**. Griefing includes but is not limited to:

- Destroying a build
- Modifying a build without the owner’s consent, or preventing an owner’s access to their build
- Spamming blocks or building any representation of genitalia in any area
- Flooding a structure
- Killing others stabled animals, villagers, or taking crops without replanting

2\. **Be mindful of space**. Please give your fellow players room to build. Also, cities are no more important than single builds. 

3\. **Staff protect builds, not claims**. Protections are an anti-griefing measure, not a land-grab technique. If you'd like a build protected, talk to a staff member. 

4\. **Banned Items** (This list may change in the future, either because of a player vote or a technical reason)
  * TNT
  * TNT Minecarts
  * Beds in Nether

###Chaos
1\. **No griefing spawn**. Areas outside spawn are fair game. 

2\. **Staff reserve the right to clean up anything which makes the game unplayable**. 

3\. **Chaos is volatile**. The map will reset as soon as possible after new major minecraft versions are released. 

###Other servers
As other servers come and go, their respective sections will be updated here. All servers will have their rules posted somewhere in that server's spawn area. 


##When Someone Breaks The Rules
The severity of the violation will largely dictate the response. Normally, a player will be warned/kicked before they are banned. Players who continue to break the rules can be banned **with or without warning**. Most bans can be appealed. Instructions for appealing can be found [here](https://junction.at/appeal). 

Do not use alt accounts to evade bans. Both you (and your alt) will recieve a longer ban duration for evading. 

If a staff member is found breaking the rules, please bring this information to another staff member. 

##Staff Guidelines
**The Number One Rule:** Real life and health always come first. This isn’t a job, it’s a game.

*The Other Number One Rule:* Always be professional in your dealings. Try not to do staff stuff while inebriated, angry, or sleepy! We are here, first and foremost, to help operate the server for the people that want to play - and as such, it is never acceptable to be rude or otherwise unprofessional to the players, even if you think they deserve it.

**Some decisions need no discussion**. For example: simple bans, answering modreqs, and day-to-day operations. These can be handled by staff unilaterally.

**Most other decisions require discussion and consensus**, and should not be handled unilaterally. For anything changing gameplay, affecting server functions, or materially changing the way the community functions, staff consensus needs to be reached. Suggestions or proposals regarding significant issues should be posted to the [staff subreddit](/r/JunctionStaff) **FIRST**. Issues presented to the staff will be given a reasonable amount of time for discussion. This amount of time may vary; some issues will be minor enough to reach a consensus on in a couple of days, while larger issues may require a week or more. There are three reasons why this process is in place:

1. This ensures that every active staff member is well aware of changes being made; unless you’re on vacation or hiatus, you should not be blindsided by any major changes.
2. There is a permanent, written record of the discussion. This means that IRC and Mumble are not acceptable for achieving consensus. If you feel something needs to be said, it needs to go on the record. After all, accountability is always a good thing.
3. The larger the issue, the more it needs a purposeful discussion. This process is in place because we don’t want decisions made in haste or without proper consideration. Problems should be resolved, not kicked down the road and allowed to fester.

###Decisions and Consensus
**A decision that affects the community requires a consensus**.  This means a proposal or change should have the approval of a 2/3 majority of the staff.  If a consensus cannot be reached by staff alone, it can be brought in front of players to be voted on and discussed. This is not a forum for staff members unhappy with a decision to take their case to the public; this process is intended for non-staff players to voice their concerns.  If a decision is brought forth to the general public, it’s acceptable to argue for or against the proposal on its merits, but try to avoid turning a public debate into an argument about staff decision.

**Once a decision is made, staff should not publicly second-guess or disparage the decision**. Please remember: These guidelines regarding staff conduct are here because we all equally represent the server to the community. Publicly complaining does not accomplish anything; it only makes things worse, it looks unprofessional.

When something needs discussion, **time is always on our side**. Waiting to make a decision is always preferable to a hasty or bad decision. In the event of major security issues, the server will be taken down and the staff will work to resolve the security issue as soon as practicable. If the issue allows the server to remain open but requires normal servers to be closed, a temporary chaos server will be created (or re-loaded). This is in accordance with our underlying philosophy that we are here to foster our community, and our community is best served by maintaining a place to play whenever practicable.

###Responsibilities
**Junction uses teams for certain functions because a small number of dedicated people can concentrate on specific things and accomplish those things quicker**.  All players and staff are welcome to give feedback to teams on their respective issues.  Some teams may include experienced non-staff players.  This is intended to allow people who are not part of the staff to be involved - and to ensure the community is broadly represented - in important matters such as resolving player disputes and planning future server revisions.

- Tech Team: These are the people making sure our server is happy and healthy. Before changing anything that changes gameplay, the Tech Committee needs to bring their proposal to the rest of the staff for discussion. The Tech Committee and the staff are charged with recognizing that holding the keys to the server - as with all staff positions - is a responsibility and not a privilege.
- Moderation Team: This group deals with the day-to-day operations of the server. This includes modreqs, enforcing rules, and helping players. The Tech Team is a subset of this team. 

Other teams will come and go as needed. 

All current teams are listed at [https://junction.at/staff](http://junction.at/staff). 


###Inactivity
Life happens. People get busy and leave for a while. However, we do need to know which staff members are still playing on Junction, and which have moved on. 

- **Inactive staff will be moved to the Inactive Staff group after 90 days and have their moderation powers temporarily removed**. You can return whenever you would like during this time. 

- **After 180 days, you will be moved to the "Former Staff" section. Once you have been moved to the Former Staff section, a vote must be held before you can return. Approval of 2/3 of the currently active staff is required before you can return**
